# Nuclei Segmentation 3D
Nuclei segmentation in 3D images using 3D Gaussian blur (user defined radius) + Thresholding (user defined) + 3 holes filling + 3D watershed.

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools 
This workflow is described in [www.biii.eu](www.biii.eu) in [http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-3d-imagej](http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-3d-imagej)
